# 📉 Unemployment Analysis with Python

## Task Description
This project is part of the CodeAlpha Data Science Internship (Task 2).
The objective is to analyze unemployment rate data using Python to
understand trends, patterns, and the impact of COVID-19 on unemployment.

## Dataset
The analysis uses two datasets:
1. Unemployment in India.csv – Overall unemployment data
2. Unemployment_Rate_upto_11_2020.csv – Data covering the COVID-19 period

The datasets contain unemployment rate percentages over time.

## Objectives
- Analyze unemployment rate trends
- Perform data cleaning and exploration
- Study the impact of COVID-19 on unemployment
- Identify seasonal or pattern-based trends
- Present insights useful for social and economic policy decisions

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Analysis Performed
- Data cleaning (handling missing values, formatting dates)
- Trend visualization using line plots
- COVID-19 impact analysis
- Seasonal trend analysis using monthly patterns

## Output
The analysis shows a significant increase in unemployment during the
COVID-19 period, along with noticeable seasonal trends across months.

## Conclusion
The results highlight how external events like pandemics strongly
affect employment levels. These insights can help policymakers and
organizations design better employment and economic recovery strategies.

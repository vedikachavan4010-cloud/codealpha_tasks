# 🌸 Iris Flower Classification

## Task Description
This project is part of the CodeAlpha Data Science Internship.
The objective is to classify Iris flower species using machine learning
based on flower measurements.

## Dataset
The Iris dataset contains measurements of flowers belonging to three species:
- Iris-setosa
- Iris-versicolor
- Iris-virginica

### Features:
- Sepal Length
- Sepal Width
- Petal Length
- Petal Width

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn

## Machine Learning Model
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classifier

## Implementation Steps
1. Load the Iris dataset
2. Preprocess the data
3. Split the dataset into training and testing sets
4. Train the KNN model
5. Evaluate the model using accuracy and classification report

## Output
The model successfully classifies Iris flower species with high accuracy.
